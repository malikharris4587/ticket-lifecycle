Say you have tickets populating from end users you created (Karen and Ken in this example) now its up to you or the Queue Manager to properly code and assign these tickets to the agents/IT Professionals. You can also work tickets yourself.

This ticket I set to SEV-A because this is a business-impacting work order. Depending on the organization, every SLA will be different.

Communication is key here. Post replies following the SLA procedures and resolve the tickets when its time. You can change the status of the ticket at the bottom here before you post a reply.
